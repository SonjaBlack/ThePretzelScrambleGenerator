# Installation:

# Bug reports, feature requests, etc.
If anybody but me ends up caring about this thing, let me know and I'll fix bugs or add proper command line options for single-line vs. multi-line printing, generating scramble sets, etc. Don't expect me to get around to generating scramble images any time soon, though. Would be nice to have those, like the WCA's tNoodle package does, but that's a whole bunch of extra work that I'm not going to do until there's a demand for it.
